# Project_Logistic_Regression_Random_Forest
In this project we are dealing with a data set where we have a classification problem.
This dataset contains about 10 years of daily weather observations from many locations across Australia.
RainTomorrow is the target variable to predict. It means -- did it rain the next day, Yes or No? This column is Yes if the rain for that day was 1mm or more.
